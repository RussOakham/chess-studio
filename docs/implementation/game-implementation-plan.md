# Game Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level implementation plan for building the core chess game functionality. The plan is organized into phases that build upon each other, starting with the essential user journey and progressing to full game mechanics.

## Current Status

✅ **Completed:**

- Project setup and configuration
- Authentication system (login/register)
- Database schema (games, moves, gameReviews tables)
- Basic chess utilities package (`packages/chess`)
- Code quality tooling (oxlint with type-aware linting, oxfmt)
- **Phase 1.1: Home/Dashboard Page Enhancement** ✅
  - "New Game" button (prominent CTA)
  - Active games list (displays in_progress/waiting games)
  - Recent games preview (last 5 completed/abandoned games)
  - Navigation to game history (link to `/games`)
  - Empty states for no games
  - Styled with ShadCN components
- **Phase 1.2: New Game Creation Flow** ✅
  - `/game/new` page with difficulty and color selectors
  - Form validation with Zod
  - Error handling and loading states
  - Redirect to game page on success
- **API Endpoints:**
  - `GET /api/games` ✅ - Lists user's active and recent games
  - `POST /api/games` ✅ - Creates new game with initial FEN position

🔄 **Next Steps:**

- Phase 1.3: Game Page Route (dynamic route for `/game/[gameId]`)
- Phase 1.4: Basic Chessboard Component (install libraries + create component)
- Phase 2: Game Mechanics (move validation, engine integration)

## Library Decision: react-chessboard

**Decision:** Use [`react-chessboard`](https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard) instead of building a custom chessboard from scratch.

**Rationale:**

- ✅ Modern, well-maintained library (492 stars, actively maintained)
- ✅ Built-in drag-and-drop functionality
- ✅ Mobile responsive out of the box
- ✅ TypeScript support
- ✅ Customizable styling
- ✅ Animation support
- ✅ Works seamlessly with `chess.js`
- ✅ Significantly reduces development time (from 4-6 hours to 2-3 hours)
- ✅ Battle-tested by 3.4k+ projects

**Integration:**

- `react-chessboard` handles all UI/UX concerns (drag-drop, animations, responsive design)
- `chess.js` handles all game logic (move validation, FEN/PGN, game state)
- Our code focuses on connecting these libraries and managing game state/persistence

- Better performance than JavaScript-only implementations
- Lower memory footprint
- Works seamlessly with `react-chessboard` (see [advanced examples](https://react-chessboard.vercel.app/?path=/docs/how-to-use-advanced-examples--docs))

**Hybrid Architecture:**

- **Client-Side (Browser)**: Quick evaluations (depth 5-8) for real-time UI feedback
  - Position evaluation bar
  - Legal move highlighting
  - Move hints (shallow analysis)
  - Instant feedback, no network latency
- **Server-Side (API)**: Engine moves and deep analysis (depth 10-20+)
  - Controlled difficulty levels
  - Rate limiting and cost control
  - Consistent performance
  - Integration with AI services

**Tasks:**

  - Accept current FEN position and difficulty level
  - Initialize Stockfish WASM in Node.js
  - Calculate best move (depth 10-20+ based on difficulty)
  - Return move in UCI format
  - Add rate limiting
- [ ] **Engine Configuration:**
  - Difficulty levels mapping:
    - Easy: depth 10-12
    - Medium: depth 15-18
    - Hard: depth 20+
  - Thinking time limits
  - Evaluation return
- [ ] **Auto-play Engine Moves:**
  - Trigger after user move
  - Show loading state while engine thinks
  - Call server-side API for engine move
  - Execute engine move automatically
  - Update game state
- [ ] **Integration with react-chessboard:**
  - Follow [advanced examples guide](https://react-chessboard.vercel.app/?path=/docs/how-to-use-advanced-examples--docs)
  - Use client-side engine for real-time evaluation
  - Use server-side engine for actual moves

**Dependencies:** 2.1, 2.2

**Estimated Time:** 8-10 hours (includes both client and server setup)

**Technical Notes:**

- **Client-Side:**
  - Limit depth to 5-8 to avoid blocking UI thread
  - Debounce evaluation requests during rapid moves
  - Cache engine instances and evaluations
  - Use Web Workers if needed for heavy calculations
- **Server-Side:**
  - Use deeper analysis (10-20+ depth) for actual moves
  - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

});
```

### API Endpoints Needed

1. `POST /api/games` - Create new game ✅ **Implemented**
2. `GET /api/games` - List user's games ✅ **Implemented**
3. `GET /api/games/[gameId]` - Get game details ❌ **Not implemented**
4. `POST /api/games/[gameId]/moves` - Make a move ❌ **Not implemented**
5. `POST /api/games/[gameId]/engine/move` - Get engine move ❌ **Not implemented**
6. `POST /api/games/[gameId]/resign` - Resign game ❌ **Not implemented**
7. `POST /api/games/[gameId]/draw` - Offer/accept draw ❌ **Not implemented**

### State Management Strategy

**Client-Side:**

- React Query or SWR for server state (game data, moves)
- Optimistic updates for moves
- Client-side Stockfish WASM for real-time evaluation (evaluation bar, move hints)
- Local caching of engine evaluations

**Server-Side:**

- Database as source of truth
- Server-side Stockfish WASM for engine moves (controlled difficulty, rate limiting)
- Real-time updates via polling (MVP) or WebSocket (future)

## User Journey Flow

```text
1. User logs in
   ↓
2. Home page shows "New Game" button
   ↓
3. User clicks "New Game"
   ↓
4. Select difficulty and color
   ↓
5. Game created → Redirect to /game/[gameId]
   ↓
6. Chessboard loads with starting position
   ↓
7. User makes move → Validated → Saved → Board updates
   ↓
8. Engine calculates move → Move executed → Board updates
   ↓
9. Repeat steps 7-8 until game ends
   ↓
10. Game end detected → Result displayed
   ↓
11. User can review game or start new game
```

## Success Criteria

Phase 1 is complete when:

- ✅ User can create a new game
- ✅ User can see a chessboard with pieces
- ✅ Basic UI is functional

Phase 2 is complete when:

- ✅ User can make valid moves
- ✅ Engine responds with moves
- ✅ Game state is saved to database
- ✅ Game end is detected correctly

Phase 3 is complete when:

- ✅ User can view game history
- ✅ User can replay past games
- ✅ All MVP game features work

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Phase 1.1**: Enhance home page with "New Game" button - **COMPLETE**
2. ✅ **Phase 1.2**: Create new game flow - **COMPLETE**
3. **Next: Phase 1.4**: Build basic chessboard component
   - Install `react-chessboard` and `chess.js`
   - Create chessboard wrapper component
4. **Then Phase 1.3**: Create game page to tie it together
   - Create `/game/[gameId]` dynamic route
   - Integrate chessboard component
   - Set up page layout

This creates a complete user journey early, even if moves aren't validated yet.

## Notes

- Build incrementally - get something working end-to-end first
- Test each phase before moving to the next
- Consider mobile responsiveness from the start
- Keep components modular and reusable
- Use TypeScript strictly for type safety
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
