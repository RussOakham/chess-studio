# Game Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the high-level implementation plan for building the core chess game functionality. The plan is organized into phases that build upon each other, starting with the essential user journey and progressing to full game mechanics.

## Current Status

✅ **Completed:**

- Project setup and configuration
- Authentication system (login/register)
- Database schema (games, moves, gameReviews tables)
- Basic chess utilities package (`packages/chess`)
- Code quality tooling (oxlint with type-aware linting, oxfmt)
- **Convex migration** ✅
  - Game and move data use Convex (queries/mutations, real-time subscriptions)
  - Type-safe API via `useQuery(api.games.*)` and `useMutation(api.games.*)`
  - No polling; Convex subscriptions for live updates
- **UUID v7** (packages/db only, if used): pg_uuidv7 in Neon for time-ordered IDs; Convex uses its own document IDs
- **Phase 1.1: Home/Dashboard Page Enhancement** ✅
  - "New Game" button (prominent CTA)
  - Active games list (displays in_progress/waiting games)
  - Recent games preview (last 5 completed/abandoned games)
  - Navigation to game history (link to `/games`)
  - Empty states for no games
  - Styled with ShadCN components
- **Phase 1.2: New Game Creation Flow** ✅
  - `/game/new` page with difficulty and color selectors
  - Form validation with Zod
  - Error handling and loading states
  - Redirect to game page on success
- **Phase 1.3: Game Page Route** ✅
  - Dynamic route for `/game/[gameId]`
  - Server-side authentication and authorization checks
  - Game data via Convex (`useQuery(api.games.getById)`, `useQuery(api.games.getMoves)`)
  - Page layout with chessboard, game info, controls, and move history
  - Client component wrapper for interactive features
- **Phase 1.4: Basic Chessboard Component** ✅
  - Installed `react-chessboard` and `chess.js`
  - Created `ChessboardWrapper` component
  - Integrated drag-and-drop functionality
  - FEN position management
  - Move validation with chess.js
  - Responsive design and styling
- **Phase 2.1: Move Validation & Execution** ✅
  - Full move validation (client and server-side)
  - `makeMove` Convex mutation implemented (`api.games.makeMove`)
  - Moves stored in Convex with full metadata
  - Game FEN and PGN updated after moves
  - Game end detection (checkmate, stalemate, draw)
  - Automatic game status and result updates
  - Comprehensive error handling
- **Phase 2.2: Game State Management** ✅
  - Created `useGame` hook (Convex `useQuery(api.games.getById)`, `useQuery(api.games.getMoves)`)
  - Real-time updates via Convex subscriptions (no polling)
  - Turn indicator showing current player
  - Check/checkmate/stalemate/draw indicators
  - Move history display with proper formatting
  - Automatic UI updates after moves

  - Optimistic/local state; Convex reactivity for persistence
  - Automatic rollback on errors

- **Phase 2.3: Stockfish Engine Integration** ✅
  - Client-side Stockfish via `useStockfish` and `/public/engine/stockfish.js`; engine moves submitted via `makeMove` mutation. No server-side engine API (client-only implementation).
- **Phase 2.4: Game Status Detection** ✅ (mostly)
  - Game end (checkmate, stalemate, draw) updates status/result in Convex; UI shows result and checkmate badge. Optional remaining: game-end modal, king-in-check highlight.
- **Phase 3.2: Game Controls (Resign)** ✅
  - `resign` Convex mutation and Resign button with confirmation implemented. Offer draw not yet wired.
- **Phase 3.3: Game History Page** ✅
  - `/games` page implemented (`app/games/page.tsx`, `GamesListClient`); "View all" from home no longer 404s.

🔄 **Next Steps:**

- Phase 3.1: Move replay (click to navigate to position) and PGN export (optional)
- Phase 3.2: Offer draw (mutation + wire button) if desired
- Phase 4: Enhanced features (evaluation bar, hints, post-game analysis)

## Library Decision: react-chessboard

**Decision:** Use [`react-chessboard`](https://github.com/Clariity/react-chessboard) instead of building a custom chessboard from scratch.

**Rationale:**

- ✅ Modern, well-maintained library (492 stars, actively maintained)
- ✅ Built-in drag-and-drop functionality
- ✅ Mobile responsive out of the box
- ✅ TypeScript support
- ✅ Customizable styling
- ✅ Animation support
- ✅ Works seamlessly with `chess.js`

// Create game with initial FEN
const game = await db.insert(games).values({
  userId: session.user.id,
  status: "in_progress",
  fen: INITIAL_FEN,
});
```

**Move Saving:**

```typescript
// Save move after validation
await db.insert(moves).values({
  gameId: game.id,
  moveNumber: moveNumber,
  moveSan: move.san,
  moveUci: move.uci,
  fenBefore: fenBefore,
  fenAfter: fenAfter,
  evaluation: engineEvaluation,
});
```

### API (Convex queries and mutations)

1. `api.games.create` - Create new game ✅ **Implemented**
2. `api.games.list` - List user's games ✅ **Implemented**
3. `api.games.getById` - Get game details ✅ **Implemented**
4. `api.games.getMoves` - Get moves for a game ✅ **Implemented**
5. `api.games.makeMove` - Make a move ✅ **Implemented**
6. Engine move - Handled client-side (Stockfish) then submitted via `makeMove` ✅
7. `api.games.resign` - Resign game ✅ **Implemented**
8. `games.offerDraw` - Offer draw ⏳ **Stub or future**
9. `games.acceptDraw` - Accept draw ⏳ **Stub or future**

### State Management Strategy

**Client-Side:**

- React state for UI state (selected square, move history display)
- Convex `useQuery` for game and move data (real-time subscriptions)
- Optimistic updates for moves; Convex reactivity for persistence
- Client-side Stockfish WASM for real-time evaluation (evaluation bar, move hints)
- Local caching of engine evaluations

**Server-Side:**

- Database as source of truth
- Server-side Stockfish WASM for engine moves (controlled difficulty, rate limiting)
- Real-time updates via Convex subscriptions

## User Journey Flow

```text
1. User logs in
   ↓
2. Home page shows "New Game" button
   ↓
3. User clicks "New Game"
   ↓
4. Select difficulty and color
   ↓
5. Game created → Redirect to /game/[gameId]
   ↓
6. Chessboard loads with starting position
   ↓
7. User makes move → Validated → Saved → Board updates
   ↓
8. Engine calculates move → Move executed → Board updates
   ↓
9. Repeat steps 7-8 until game ends
   ↓
10. Game end detected → Result displayed
   ↓
11. User can review game or start new game
```

## Success Criteria
