# tRPC Patterns (Deprecated)

This project **no longer uses tRPC** for the game and move API. That layer has been removed in favour of **Convex**.

For current patterns, see:

- **Convex backend and client**: [.cursor/rules/convex.mdc](.cursor/rules/convex.mdc)
- **Migration and auth**: [docs/temp/migrate-convex.temp.md](docs/temp/migrate-convex.temp.md)

Game and move data use Convex queries and mutations (`api.games.*`) with real-time subscriptions. Auth is Better Auth with Convex JWT integration.
