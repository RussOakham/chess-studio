# Documentation Standards

This project follows industry best practices for technical documentation, inspired by companies like Stripe, Google, and DigitalOcean.

## Core Principles

### 1. Helpful and Encouraging (The "Mentor")

Write like a competent partner helping finish a task, not a cold machine or condescending expert.

**Examples:**

- ❌ "The user must ensure the API key is valid or the request will fail."
- ✅ "Make sure your API key is valid so your requests can go through smoothly."

### 2. Active and Direct

Use the **imperative mood** (giving commands). It's shorter, clearer, and more authoritative.

**Examples:**

- ❌ "The `Save` button should be clicked to record the move."
- ✅ "Click **Save** to record the move."

### 3. Objective and Neutral

Avoid marketing "fluff" or subjective adjectives like "easy," "simple," or "powerful." If a user finds a task difficult and you call it "easy," they will feel frustrated.

**Examples:**

- ❌ "Just use our incredibly simple UUID generator to quickly fix your database."
- ✅ "Use the UUID generator to organize your database."

### 4. Concise and Scannable

Developers rarely read documentation word-for-word. They "grep" for the answer.

**Use:**

- **Bold text** for UI elements or key terms
- Code blocks for anything technical
- Lists to break up complex steps

## Tone by Scenario

| Scenario | Tone | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tutorials** | Educational & Warm | "In this guide, we'll build a chess engine..." |
| **API Reference** | Precise & Technical | "Returns a `Game` object with a 200 OK status." |
| **Error Messages** | Empathetic & Solution-oriented | "Game ID not found. Please check the ID and try again." |
| **Troubleshooting** | Direct & Fact-based | "If the move fails to sync, check your connection." |

## Golden Rules

### 1. Don't Use "We"

Documentation is about what the *user* is doing, not what *you* (the developer) did.

- ❌ "We built this library to be installed..."
- ✅ "Install the library..."

### 2. Avoid "Just" and "Simply"

These are "diminutive" words. If the user is struggling, these words make them feel like the problem is their fault.

- ❌ "Just run this command..."
- ✅ "Run this command..."

### 3. Define Acronyms

Even if it feels obvious, define it the first time.

- ✅ "FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation)"
- ✅ "tRPC (TypeScript Remote Procedure Call)"

## Structure Requirements

### 1. Be Concise

- Get to the point quickly
- Remove unnecessary words
- Use bullet points and lists
- Break up long paragraphs

### 2. Link to Online Documentation

Reference official documentation and best practices:

- Link to library documentation (e.g., Next.js, tRPC, Drizzle)
- Link to standards (e.g., Conventional Commits, REST API best practices)
- Link to relevant blog posts or guides

**Example:**

```markdown
For more information, see the [Next.js App Router documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).
```

### 3. Show Code Examples

Always include relevant code examples from the repository:

- Use file references: `@apps/web/lib/trpc/routers/games.router.ts`
- Show complete, working examples
- Explain what the code does
- Link to the actual file in the repo

**Example:**

```markdown
The tRPC router uses the service layer pattern:

@apps/web/lib/trpc/routers/games.router.ts
```

### 4. Source of Truth

Documentation must reflect the **current state** of the codebase:

- ✅ Reference only current, active code
- ❌ Do not reference legacy code or deprecated patterns
- ❌ Do not document past migrations or historical changes
- ✅ Update documentation when code changes
- ✅ Remove outdated information immediately

**Examples:**

- ❌ "Previously, we used axios, but now we use tRPC..."
- ✅ "Use tRPC for type-safe API calls..."

- ❌ "After migrating from UUID v4 to UUID v7..."
- ✅ "All IDs use UUID v7 (time-ordered UUIDs)..."

### 5. Temporary Documentation

Temporary documentation (implementation plans, migration notes, etc.) must use the `.temp.*` extension:

- Use `.temp.md` or `.temp.mdc` for temporary markdown files
- These files are gitignored and won't be committed
- Use for work-in-progress documentation that shouldn't be part of commit history

**Examples:**

- ✅ `docs/implementation/game-implementation-plan.temp.md`
- ✅ `docs/migration-notes.temp.mdc`
- ❌ `docs/implementation/game-implementation-plan.md` (if temporary)

**When to use temporary docs:**

- Implementation plans that are actively being worked on
- Migration notes that are no longer relevant after migration completes
- Scratch notes or brainstorming documents
- Any documentation that shouldn't be part of the permanent codebase

## Writing Style

### Pro-Tip

Write as if you are explaining the code to a friend who is a junior developer. Be clear, don't assume they know everything, but don't talk down to them.

### Formatting Guidelines

- **Bold** for UI elements, buttons, menu items
- `code` for file names, function names, variables
- Code blocks for multi-line examples
- Lists for step-by-step instructions
- Tables for comparing options or scenarios
